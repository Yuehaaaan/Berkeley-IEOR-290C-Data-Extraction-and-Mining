Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By: ""Expiring Soon"" option instead of the default ""Popularity"", and then work to get them funded.  See our team FAQ, linked above (the ""Team Website"" button, next to our traffic light avatar).  A Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):  Red Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box  with the notice that says ""Only x days left!"" or  ""Only x hours and y minutes left!""  LLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where  lenders work together to keep loans from  expiring.  SFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current  practice, one of these lists is prepared and  posted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus  and coordinate their lending on a targeted  group of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists  are prepared by a group of volunteers who  seek to be objective in selecting the loans to  be included in their lists. They also seek to  spread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour  period and to share the joy among the Field  Partners with loans expiring during that period,  but their efforts are always constrained by the  choice of loans that are available for inclusion  in the list. Loans with larger amounts needed  will be included in the period immediately after  each Credit Day, when lenders are feeling  flush, but the lists will become less ambitious  when the LLL lenders are feeling poor.  GG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers have the option of adding one or two of these  loans after their SFDD lists. As the name  implies, only group loans are picked. When it is  first posted, a typical GG loan will expire two  days or more after the list is posted. It will  usually be retained as a GG until it becomes  Fully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.  RTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are  prepared and posted when there are large  numbers of loans slated to expire in a short  period of time, typically at the end of a calen- dar month. ""Red"" is a reference to the red  boxes that are added to a loan description  when the Loan is about to expire without full  funding.  BtB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where  there aren't 12 loans that qualify as ""Starfish,""  the listmakers will include BtB loans to help  focus attention on the red-boxed loans with the best chances. The criteria are similar to SF  loans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable  amounts left to fund (not too much; not too  little). If they gain good traction on their first BtB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.  Bulge: A short period in which a great many  loans have their scheduled funding expiration  times. Bulges come about primarily when a  Field Partner (FP) submits an amount of loans  to Kiva during a given month than is greater  than the FP's quota for that month. The loan  descriptions are prepared for posting by  translating the loan descriptions (if necessary)  and editing them, and they are then held to be posted at the beginning of the following month. Bulge loans are prize candidates for inclusion  in Reduce the Red lists.  FF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan  that has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are  fundraising and to move into repaying status.  Lars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded. (Developed by team member Lars)  Wiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation ""again walker,"" meaning ""undead,"" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.  Ruma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation ""ugly words.""  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.  See data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva: www.kivatools.com An older version, no longer being maintained, is:  kivany.vijayr.net/expiring_loans.php  See data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan: starfish.dynalias.org/  kivalive.com (older version) www.kivalive.com/index2.php  Lists are posted on the LLL Team message  board.

Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.    Through Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!  Through our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us? .",Smile Train,16109,"About us We are a diverse group of Kiva lenders from different backgrounds and different areas of the world who share a common desire to support the effort to bring a repair surgery to every child who needs one.  Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!  The little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.  Where is Pinki Now - bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.

Similar loans by other lenders are combined until the required total is reached. This enables people without access to traditional banks (including many women) to expand their businesses, support and educate their children, save for the future and raise themselves out of poverty. As your money is repaid (often in monthly instalments), you can withdraw it or lend it to someone else. Money that is loaned over and over again does more good than a one-time donation!  Anyone *who makes a loan* through Kiva can be a member of this team.

Sufferers are afflicted by an absence of melanin, a pigmentation defect in the hair, skin and eyes. It causes vulnerability to sun exposure and bright light. Many have very poor vision as a consequence. In tropical countries especially they can be vulnerable to skin cancers if unprotected from the sun.  Though it might seem absurdly obvious, Albinism has nothing to do with magical powers.   But in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, albinos have traditionally faced discrimination and prejudice. They are associated with the supernatural. To some, a white-skinned African person is seen as a kind of phantom or ghost, who rather than die will dissolve or disappear with the wind and rain.   Over the last five years in Tanzania, however, the situation has become much, much worse, with albinos increasingly subjected to murder and mutilation because of a completely absurd myth that albino body parts are effective in witchcraft rituals. Albino bones are also used as good luck charms and people believe they can make you rich.",Spell of the Albino,3994,"About us Attacks on albinos continue, despite international outrage and repeated attempts by the Tanzanian government to stamp out this truly appalling practice, since it first came to light that many albinos have been hunted down and attacked purely for their limbs and organs.   Officially there are around 8,000 albinos registered by the Tanzania Albino Society (TAS), but they says the real number is in excess of 170,000. Many albinos are still kept hidden by their families because of the stigma or because of fear that they might be attacked.  Please check following documentary: www.aljazeera.com/programmes/africainvestigates/2011/11/201111185428766652.html Meet two albino children, victims of vicious assault.

She gave to anyone who called with a good story, and she gave to anyone who asked in the mail. I am still trying to get the mail stopped and our number off the call lists.  To keep up the helping and cut down on the fundraiser overhead I have been lending money on KIVA.  Kiva's mission is to connect people, through lending, for the sake of alleviating poverty.  Kiva empowers individuals to lend to an entrepreneur across the globe. By combining microfinance with the internet, Kiva is creating a global community of people connected through lending.  Kiva was born of the following beliefs: People are by nature generous, and will help others if given the opportunity to do so in a transparent, accountable way.  The poor are highly motivated and can be very successful when given an opportunity.  By connecting people we can create relationships beyond financial transactions, and build a global community expressing support and encouragement of one another.  Kiva promotes: Dignity:   Kiva encourages partnership relationships as opposed to benefactor relationships. Partnership relationships are characterized by mutual dignity and respect.  Accountability:   Loans encourage more accountability than donations where repayment is not expected.  Transparency:   The Kiva website is an open platform where communication can flow freely around the world.   This way I can keep up Dorothea's giving without giving the money away and use it over and over. To keep Dorothea in our minds and hearts I have started a KIVA Team ""Dorothea's Legacy"" where we can as a group help other people in Dorothea's name.  I will be sending you an invitation to join us in KIVA and to join the team. I have been sending gift certificates for birthday presents. The gift certificate is good only for lending in KIVA but after it has been repaid it can then either be re-loaned or taken out with pay pal.  This is not a scam. It will not make anyone money. It is not a gift. If you have some money that you could spare for six months or so, why not lend it to some one who can make good use of it.

In many societies a serious approach to reproductive health has to have this perspective in mind. We must seek to liberate women."" -  Dr. Nafis Sadik Executive Director, UN Population Fund -   **** THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD HEALTH & EDUCATION TO A WOMAN'S WELL-BEING - AND THAT OF HER FAMILY & SOCIETY - CANNOT BE OVERSTATED.    - - Without reproductive health and freedom, women cannot fully exercise their fundamental human rights, such as those relating to education and employment. Yet around the world, the right to health, and especially reproductive and sexual health, is far from a reality for many women. According to the World Bank, a full one-third of the illness among women ages 15-44 in developing countries is related to pregnancy, childbirth, abortion, reproductive tract infections, and human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).  Women's disproportionate poverty, low social status, and reproductive role expose them to high health risks, resulting in needless and largely preventable suffering and deaths. Many of the women and girls who die each year during pregnancy and childbirth could have been saved by relatively low-cost improvements in reproductive healthcare; yet high levels of maternal mortality persist. The benefits of eliminating the harmful and painful practice of female genital mutilation are easily demonstrated, yet it persists for cultural and traditional reasons. And a large proportion of abortions, some resulting in death and injury, would be avoided if women and men had access to safe, affordable and effective means of contraception. - -        www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/women/womrepro.htm - - - - - - - -   **** EVERY MINUTE, A WOMAN DIES IN PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH - -  this adds up to more than 10 million over a generation. - - Almost all of these women - 99 per cent - live and die in developing countries. A high maternal death rate is an indicator of an inadequate health care system, including those that offer poor and only limited access to health services. It also indicates that a woman’s fundamental rights to life and health are being violated. - - - Yet the vast majority of maternal deaths could be prevented. In industrialized countries, deaths owing to pregnancy and childbirth are rare. The maternal death rate in East Asia and Latin America has also decreased - by as much as 50 per cent in some countries. But in Africa and South Asia, complications during pregnancy and childbirth remain the most frequent cause of death for women. - - In some countries the number is increasing. And when women suffer and die, children suffer and die also. - - We know what it takes to save women’s lives: universal access to contraception to avoid unintended pregnancies, access to skilled care during delivery, and rapid access to quality emergency obstetric care when required. - - - - -   **** THE CURRENT SITUATION  •  Every year, 536,000 women die from pregnancy related causes. This adds up to more than 10 million women over a generation. Every year, more than 1 million children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death.  Children who have lost their mothers are up to 10 times more likely to die prematurely than those who haven’t. The risk of a woman dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth during her lifetime is about 1 in 7 in Niger and about 1 in 48,000 in Ireland. 10-15 million women a year suffer severe or long-lasting illnesses or disabilities caused by complications during pregnancy or childbirth. These range from obstetric fistula to infertility and depression. The main reasons for maternal deaths are haemorrhage, infections, unsafe abortions, high blood pressure leading to seizures and obstructed labor. - - - -   **** CONTRACEPTION & UNSAFE ABORTIONS - - - -  200 million women want to delay or avoid pregnancy but are not using effective contraceptives. One in three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had access to it. An estimated 19 million unsafe abortions take place each year in developing countries. Every year, an estimated 68,000 women die as the result of unsafe abortions and millions more suffer complications. About 90% of abortion-related deaths and disabilities worldwide could be avoided if women who wished to had access to effective contraception. - - -    *** SKILLED ASSISTANCE & EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC CARE • The number of maternal deaths is highest in countries where women are least likely to have skilled attendance at delivery. • Worldwide, 62 per cent of births are attended by a skilled health worker. Almost all births in developed countries are attended. In less developed countries, the figure is 57 per cent. In least developed countries it falls to only 34 per cent. • An estimated 35 per cent of pregnant women in developing countries do not have contact with health personnel prior to giving birth. • In sub-Saharan Africa, where most maternal deaths occur, about 70 per cent have no contact with health personnel following childbirth. • Mortality is highest during labour and the two days following a birth. • Women who undergo infibulation—a radical form of female genital mutilation that involves stitching of the external genitalia—are at higher risk of complications during and following childbirth - -  www.unfpa.org/safemotherhood/mediakit/documents/fs/factsheet1_eng.pdf",Freethinkers & Humanists in Favor of Choice,1775,"About us *** ""Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism and other supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity"":   - -   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Humanist_Association - - - - - - - - - - - -      *** Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or any other dogma.

More than 80 ethnic groups live here, creating the variety of cultures and traditions. It serves as a trade crossroad and a trans-shipment point between the Europe and Asia as before when it used to be a connecting-link between north and south directions of Silk Way.   The economy of Kyrgyzstan was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet trading block. More than 20% of the Kyrgyz population has left to other parts of the Soviet Union within past 10 years to seek work.  While strong growth in neighboring Kazakhstan and China has created opportunities for expansion, Kyrgyzstan remains a small economy vulnerable to external shocks.

The Order is still true to its founding principles of charity, unity and fraternity.  The Knights was formed to render financial aid to members and their families. Mutual aid and assistance are offered to sick, disabled and needy members and their families. Social and intellectual fellowship is promoted among members and their families through educational, charitable, religious, social welfare, war relief and public relief works.  The history of the Order shows how the foresight of Father Michael J. McGivney, whose cause for sainthood is being investigated by the Vatican, brought about what has become the world's foremost Catholic fraternal benefit society. The Order has helped families obtain economic security and stability through its life insurance, annuity and long-term care programs, and has contributed time and energy worldwide to service in communities.  The Knights of Columbus has grown from several members in one council to more than 13,000 councils and 1.7 million members throughout the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, Poland, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama, the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Guam and Saipan.",0,Alumni Groups,2008-09-2,67,0,39925,http://www.kiva.org/team/knights_of_columbus,0,0

Why keep money sitting around somewhere when it could be much more useful as capital for entrepreneurs?,Kiva Savings Account,1275,"About us Many people have large amounts of money just lying around, not accruing interest or being utilized in any useful way. This team is about making that money work – by shifting excess unused capital from your household into Kiva, you can help others while staying financially secure!  Keeping a high balance in your checking/savings account is unnecessary for many people. The interest you earn on this amount, even in high-yield savings, usually won’t even top $100 on $10,000 in one year. How many Kiva entrepreneurs could you help with that money? (Answer: up to 400!)  Shift some of that redundant money to Kiva and help alleviate poverty!  Notes: Since this money is being shifted from funds that you are somewhat used to having at your disposition, it is important that you are selective with your loans. You can loan to whoever you want, but it’s prudent to have this money available in a reasonable amount of time. Remember, you cannot get money from Kiva back immediately; you have to wait for repayments. That’s why we recommend investing in short-term loans of 5 or 6 months (so your repayments come in quickly and you can recoup all of your capital within half a year), spreading loans across multiple entrepreneurs/field partners (“diversifying” your loans to mitigate risk), and choosing field partners that have at least a 3-star rating (higher ratings means less delinquent/defaulted loans).

Mirembe Community College (MCC), located in Kampala, Uganda, was founded by Florence Kaluuba assisted by a group of counselors and teachers to address the causes and consequences of dropping out of school among pregnant school-age girls, young mothers and other vulnerable or orphaned girls.  While the reasons girls drop out of school are complex, it is clear that pregnancy and parenting responsibilities are a significant factor, and the economic consequences of dropping out of school are devastating for these teen mothers, their children, and their communities.   Often, girls that become pregnant in school are expelled or leave school out of shame, reducing their chances of securing a better life for themselves and their children.  Since its inception in 1996, the MCC has been helping girls who have dropped out of school to improve health, nutrition and education for themselves and their children and to acquire vocational skills for gainful employment and job creation.    Vocational training programs include pre-school teacher training, catering, tailoring, hairdressing, crafts making and computer technology.   These youth achieve a vocational education in a very short period of 4-12 months and the programs are designed to suit the individual's basic needs for self reliance.   The Early childhood Centre caters to children aged 3-5 years.  It was created to provide play and early childhood education for the students’ children.  Currently the benefits are far reaching to other children in the community as well.  The Centre is run by the parents/guardians with support from Plan-Uganda.  The College has, since its inception, trained 600 young people, 80% of whom are employed, 20 % self employed in groups or as individuals.  With the little resources available we have strengthened the girls with the ability to overcome severe hardships resulting from the devastation of families by HIV pandemic and poverty.   Mirembe Community College - We release young women from despair into a life of dignity and purpose.  mirembecommunitycollege.info/ .",Mirembe CC Uganda,723,"About us This is the Kiva loan which started it all on May 11, 2007. www.kiva.org/lend/9970  This is the Fellow's Blog by Drew Kinder which introduced Kiva lenders to Florence and MCC: fellowsblog.kiva.org/2007/12/11/mikembe-youth-development-project/  You can learn more about the history of the ongoing relationship between Kiva lenders from around the world and Mirembe Community College in Uganda, written up at the KivaFriends Forum, here bit.ly/MirembeHistory  The last fundraiser for the school has been made in spring 2011.

Abdusattor drove a car for a living, but he wanted a loan to begin selling watermelons. Meanwhile, Mirmahmud sold watermelons, but he wanted a loan to purchase a car. When these loans posted on the same day, we knew that we had to get them together!  Cars and watermelons? They go together in ways we never would have imagined!  In the developing world, entrepreneurs sometimes wind up in unlikely professions or combining businesses  that we might not ordinarily expect to go together.  Through such immprobable business combinations, these entrepreneuers have found ways to be successful by filling the unique needs of their communities.   This team  celebrates all of the wonderful and unlikely enterprises and pairings of enterprises that Kiva borrowers are involved in. Of course, we have a special soft spot for ""watermelon+car"" loans.

We want to see a better world!,Zeitgeist Movement Italia,339,"About us Founded in 2008, The Zeitgeist Movement is a Sustainability Advocacy Organization which conducts community based activism and awareness actions through a network of Global/Regional Chapters, Project Teams, Annual Events, Media and Charity Work.  The Movement's principle focus includes the recognition that the majority of the social problems which plague the human species at this time are not the sole result of some institutional corruption, scarcity, a political policy, a flaw of ""human nature"" or other commonly held assumptions of causality.  Rather, The Movement recognizes that issues such as poverty, corruption, collapse, homelessness, war, starvation and the like appear to be ""Symptoms"" born out of an outdated social structure. While intermediate Reform steps and temporal Community Support are of interest to The Movement, the defining goal here is the installation of a new socioeconomic model based upon technically responsible Resource Management, Allocation and Distribution through what would be considered The Scientific Method of reasoning problems and finding optimized solutions.  This ""Resource-Based Economic Model"" is about taking a direct technical approach to social management as opposed to a Monetary or even Political one. It is about updating the workings of society to the most advanced and proven methods Science has to offer, leaving behind the damaging consequences and limiting inhibitions which are generated by our current system of monetary exchange, profits, corporations and other structural and motivational components.  The Movement is loyal to a train of thought, not figures or institutions. In other words, the view held is that through the use of socially targeted research and tested understandings in Science and Technology, we are now able to logically arrive at societal applications which could be profoundly more effective in meeting the needs of the human population. In fact, so much so, that there is little reason to assume war, poverty, most crimes and many other money-based scarcity effects common in our current model cannot be resolved over time.  The range of The Movement's Activism & Awareness Campaigns extend from short to long term, with the model based explicitly on Non-Violent methods of communication. The long term view, which is the transition into a Resource-Based Economic Model, is a constant pursuit and expression, as stated before. However, in the path to get there, The Movement also recognizes the need for transitional Reform techniques, along with direct Community Support.  For instance, while ""Monetary Reform"" itself is not an end solution proposed by The Movement, the merit of such legislative approaches are still considered valid in the context of transition and temporal integrity. Likewise, while food and clothes drives and other supportive projects to help those in need today are also not considered a long term solution, it is still considered valid in the context of helping others in a time of need, while also drawing awareness to the principle goal.  The Zeitgeist Movement also has no allegiance to a country or traditional political platforms. It views the world as a single system and the human species as a single family and recognizes that all countries must disarm and learn to share resources and ideas if we expect to survive in the long run. Hence, the solutions arrived at and promoted are in the interest to help everyone on the planet Earth, not a select group.",0,Common Interest,2012-02-22,11,0,10050,http://www.kiva.org/team/zeitgeist_movement_italia,0,0

We agree that the church exists for the benefit of its non-members and that God’s interest is both personal and social, individual and systemic.  So we serve by partnering with organizations and meeting needs.",0,Religious Congregations,2009-04-23,10,0,9300,http://www.kiva.org/team/narratechurch,0,0

""I AM SUPPORTING LOCAL BUSINESS""  Save 10% when you shop locally with your  CafeRoost Community Card!  www.caferoost.com  Anyone can join this team.",CafeRoost & Forever,349,"About us 10 reasons to shop local …things to let your customers know   1. Local shops sell a wide range of great products at affordable prices.  Many people get out of the habit of shopping locally and are then surprised by the range of products and gifts available.  2. Shopping locally saves you money  Out of town shops have done a good job of convincing us all that sole traders = expensive, but the evidence just isn’t there to back this up. If you add in travel, parking costs, fees to transport larger items home and customer time, the overall cost is often much greater.  3. Shopping locally retains our communities  People don’t like losing shops and services in small towns and villages but don’t equate this to how they spend their money. Shops will only survive if customers spend locally – so if you want a vibrant town centre, where people can socialise as well as shop, we need to encourage people to shop locally.  4. Shopping locally retains our distinctiveness – avoid clone towns!  Many town centres in Britain look the same with franchises and multinationals. Independent shops create distinctive shopping experiences and stock different products. Independent shops keep traditional local products alive. They respond more quickly to the needs of local customers, stocking products to meet the changing population needs. They can also be more innovative…….organic products were first developed by independent traders!  5. Shopping locally saves the environment  We are all aware of CO2 emissions and our environmental impact. Local shops often stock a higher percentage of locally sourced goods for which distribution time and customer journey times are reduced. This helps reduce our global footprint.  6. Shopping locally creates jobs  Shops in our town centres and villages create local employment and self employment. These people in turn spend in the local economy. Over half a million people are employed in retail in our rural towns and villages. Evidence shows that for every £10 spent in an independent shop, £25 is generated for the local economy compared to £14 spent in multinationals.  7. Local independent shops invest more in our communities  Sole traders and independent stores are proportionally more generous in their support for local charities, carnivals, schools and community events. So supporting local shops means a financial return for our community.  8. Local shops are for everyone  Most people can get to their local shops easily. This is especially important for the elderly, the vulnerable, young people and those without private transport. Keeping your shops open by buying locally helps the whole community.  9. Local shops value you more  Evidence from numerous surveys shows people receive better customer care and service in local shops. Traders survive by their reputation and repeat business – so shopping locally means that you get a higher standard of service.  10. Shopping locally saves services  Private, voluntary and public sector services cluster around shops. The loss of the high street often corresponds to a reduction in these services. As shops disappear, so do hairdressers, vets, dentists etc",0,Friends,2010-08-1,8,0,8750,http://www.kiva.org/team/caferoost,0,0

SAGA is fun, innovative, 100% non-profit, and we will change your attitude about global poverty. Our mission is simple: to get YOU thinking because you are more powerful than you think. Students are the future of the world and as such, we can determine what kind of world we want to live in and what kind of world we want for future generations. SAGA, as young minds with open hearts, strongly believe that that the suffering of fellow human beings is the greatest shame of our modern society. We seek a world of hope, tolerance and social justice — where poverty is defeated and all human beings on the planet live in peace, security and sustainability. Tsk…. not possible you say.

So far the total amount is 700$ and we are looking forward to your contribution thought the purpose of the site is not to ""donate"" exactly but more like help people help themselves. I think the video explains things better: youtu.be/meVAPscrGsI  I know what you are thinking: ""Right now with the state the economy is in, it's definitely not a time for a move like this"". But you are wrong: This is precisly the time. A browse throught the site will convince you that you are in fact much richer than what you thought and you are not powerless against poverty. The pros of this site is:  1) You don't actually give away your money. You will get them back! (the repayment rate is 98.65%)  2) The loan start from 25.00 USD that is a very small amount. Check out www.xe.com/ucc/ to get the exact rate but anyway it's less than 20 euros. That's affordable even in the tightest budgets.  3) Unlike all the other attempts it's easy to see how much money has been raised through the team www.kiva.org/team/sakis_rouvas_fans but that doesn't interfere with the return of the loan to your paypal account or with the process (you don't give the funds to a particular person in the group) Copy - pasting from the site: Kiva lenders who wish to lend as a group can form a lending team. This allows anyone on the team to see which borrowers other team members are lending to and allows you to track the impact that your group is making on Kiva.",0,Clubs,2011-04-3,3,0,6875,http://www.kiva.org/team/sakis_rouvas_fans,0,0

We believe that with just a little help, hard working people can make a better life for themselves and their families.",Friends of Sadie and Cole,232,"About us Dear friends and family,  As my birthday and the holidays approach, I have been asked the question for the 37th year in a row “So….. what do you want?”  As most of you know, the last couple of years have been a big transition for me, turning my career towards the issue of poverty in developing countries. Last year while living in South Africa, Melissa, Sadie, Cole and I saw firsthand how people in poverty live. I’ve learned how poor people don’t really want “hand outs”, but could certainly use a “hand up”.  This holiday season, the only gift I really want is for my friends and family to experience what that means to me. All it will take is 25 minutes and a loan of $25. KIVA.org is a website that allows you to make a $25 loan to a micro-entrepreneur in a developing country, so that they can build a business to develop income and provide for their family. On the website, you can choose the specific entrepreneur and the business that you want to lend to: for example a restaurateur in Cambodia, a goat herder in Uganda, or a farmer in Peru. Since 2005, KIVA has provided over 340,000 loans worth $260M dollars with an amazing 98.3% repayment rate. That means you not only help someone get their business off the ground, but history says there is a 98.3% chance you get your $25 back! KIVA has won many awards, and has been profiled by Time Magazine, Fortune, New York Times, not to mention being named as one of Oprah’s favorite things.  I’ve created an online lending team with KIVA called “Friends of Sadie and Cole” and am hoping you can help me get to a total of 25 loans on there by Dec 25. Click here: www.kiva.org/team/friends_of_sadie_and_cole to learn more.  Here’s a short video on how it works: vimeo.com/16991128  25 minutes and $25 could be a game changer to help someone in the developing world get on their feet in 2012. Would love to hear your opinions and what you thought about the experience.   Thanks and looking forward to celebrating this holiday season with you, whether in person or from afar!  Albert",0,Friends,2011-11-30,48,0,6725,http://www.kiva.org/team/friends_of_sadie_and_cole,0,0

This number decreases quickly over time so that by the time a loan has been posted for an hour it has decreased to just 3.  What I hope this shows is that the main weight of this formula is the Amount Raised in the Last Hour (which should work in the favor of the LLL to get loans that are being supported by you guys to the top of the sort!). Overall Fundraising Rate is a much smaller weight, which mostly just helps to put loans that have funded a bit faster overall above those who have been slower (when they are both currently funding a lot in the last hour). The Age on Kiva ""boost"" (as I like to call it) helps give every loan their ""moment in the sun"" when they first are posted to Kiva.

The loan is still yours, and repayments still come to you - but you can also choose to have the loan show up in the team's collective portfolio, so the team's overall impact will grow!  How do I make a Kiva loan? Select an entrepreneur on the Kiva website, checkout, and receive updates as the entrepreneur repays the loan.

We tend to believe that the first priority is to secure on-going reliable income, because it makes other good things possible.  For our purposes, an ""income-producing durable asset"" is defined as any asset that will continue to generate income for a long time after the loan that was used to purchase it has been paid off. This description would not be used to describe a loan only for materials consumed during production. For example, the Income-Producing Durable Asset description would be used for a sewing machine, but not for cloth and thread. Dairy cattle, beehives, fruit trees, nut trees, etc., would qualify, because they continue to produce income year after year, but seeds and fertilizer for one year would not qualify. The use of the item, not the item itself, would determine whether the Income-producing Durable Asset description is appropriate. Computers would qualify, if they are to be used directly to generate income, for example by running computer games in an entertainment center. A blender would qualify if it would be used to make juices for sale. However, the Income-Producing Durable Asset description would not be appropriate for either of these items if they were bought for personal use.",Income-Producing Durable Asset Lenders,170,"About us This team was formed to facilitate communication between lenders who prefer to make loans to buy income-producing durable assets.

Endeavor to get an “Income-Producing Durable Asset” tag created by Kiva. The creation of this tag has already been requested. 3. Lobby Kiva, if it should become appropriate, to create an “Income-Producing Durable Asset” loan attribute.

He goes to great pains to instruct his children on the importance of being open-minded, judicious, generous neighbors and citizens. He is eventually revealed to be an expert marksman, but he had chosen to keep this fact hidden from his children so that they would not in any way think of him as a man of violence.

The distinctive appearance both appeals to the intended users and discourages gray-market traffic. There is no mistaking what it is and for whom it is intended.  The XO is also designed for constant connectivity.

Kiva was fun.  Engineers tend to think in numbers - they rely on numbers for anything and everything. Some take it to the extreme (like using numbers in relationships - classifying/rating friends etc). Obviously, this is not the right thing to do. Depending on numbers is good, as long as it is done artfully and within reason. Problem is - we have so much data today, and such powerful tools to analyze these data that it is pure fun to play with it and very easy to lose track of the big picture/real goal.  LATEST ACTIVITY  Please reinstate the positioning and the format of the ""latest activity"" (to prior to the Feb 19th changes) One was encouraged to join in and even if it was just to see the same picture appear multiple times across the team board. This often happened especially in small teams. Now latest activity is barely visible, because it was shrinked and moved to the lower part of the page.   MESSAGE BOARDS  We critize an overall decline of message board functionality. If one checks in to read messages, no one wants to have to click twice – do not abbreviate messages. It is also no fun to find that one has to leave the messages area to see anything else. It is not inviting about posting messages because before being able to post a, say, question, one has to click „View All“ and there is no indication that that would get you to posting messages. Featured messages subtly alter the relationships between the Team Captains and the regular team members, and that is not a good thing especially if a website is about leveling the playing field. Mechanically, those (usually long) featured posts are getting in the way when lenders try to communicate with each other. The Flag button creates an atmosphere that makes lively discussions less likely. The profile pics appear smaller than before  PERSONAL PORTFOLIO  ""It can be difficult to accept the limits on our ability to help others...But when you help just one person, or let one person help you, it can be hard not to glimpse the better world so frustratingly near our grasp."" (The International Bank of Bob pg. 311)  Now the portfolio is just another bunch of numbers judging your effectivity. An acceptable solution would be to make a separate page for stats and not make it default. For those who want stats, they can go there and for those of us who just want to check those occasionally we can ignore that page easily.    The page you see when paying for loans got cluttered up.

We are committed to sustainable agricultural practices that yield top quality produce, grapes and wines while protecting the environment and supporting our community and farmers.   ""Agriculture has changed dramatically, especially since the end of World War II. Food and fiber productivity soared due to new technologies, mechanization, increased chemical use, specialization and government policies that favored maximizing production....  Although these changes have had many positive effects and reduced many risks in farming, there have also been significant costs. Prominent among these are topsoil depletion, groundwater contamination, the decline of family farms, continued neglect of the living and working conditions for farm laborers, increasing costs of production, and the disintegration of economic and social conditions in rural communities.  A growing movement has emerged during the past two decades to question the role of the agricultural establishment in promoting practices that contribute to these social problems. Today this movement for sustainable agriculture is garnering increasing support and acceptance within mainstream agriculture. Not only does sustainable agriculture address many environmental and social concerns, but it offers innovative and economically viable opportunities for growers, laborers, consumers, policymakers and many others in the entire food system."" - University of California Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program",Wineries for Good,113,,0,Businesses,2010-06-30,14,0,2900,http://www.kiva.org/team/wineries_for_good,0,0

It took my mother's family mortgaging their futures and borrowing from their friend based on their reputations to be able to finance the purchase of this business.

Often there is little legislative protection, and developing countries are targeted. Trawling is compared to clear felling of forests. Old fish, which still reproduce are scooped up.  Ancient corals are destroyed. Our detailed knowledge of these areas is scant. Much is lost before it has even been described.[…]  THE DEL MAR MARINE SEEP, [www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/deep-sea-trenchjpg/5306970] only discovered in 2012 is not far from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in southern California. At 1020m it illustrates how little we know of the deep sea, right in the backyard of Scripps.  Bubbles emanat[ing] from the sea floor contain methane, a potent green house gas whose emissions from buried gas hydrates, may increase due to ocean warming, but could also represent a valuable energy source.  The colorful mats of bacteria may contain genetic resources of future use, while the reasons for rockfish use of this habitat remain unknown.  Margins like this one are often heavily trawled before discovery of unusual habitats like this methane seep. (Lisa Levin) […]   CHANGING OCEAN CURRENTS CHANGE FISH HABITATS  www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/changing-ocean-currents-change-fish-habitats/5307524#transcript  The East Australia Current is now pushing further south. As the current changes, so too do the habitats of marine creatures as the water temperature and salinity change. […] Stephanie Brodie: During the beginning of 2012, the waters off Hobart had a visitor which had never been seen before. This visitor was the popular yellowtail kingfish, a fish prized for its flesh and its fight. But why was this fish discovered almost 400 kilometres further south of its known range? The culprit is the East Australia Current, known as the EAC and made famous by the popular movie ""Finding Nemo."" This ocean current runs along the east coast of Australia, shifting warm water from the Coral Sea towards Tasmania. Due to winds associated with climate change, the EAC has strengthened in recent years and is extending warmer and saltier waters further south, changing marine habitats along the way.  The arrival of new marine species to this south-eastern corner of Australia has not been uncommon in recent years and is a product of these shifting waters alternating oceanic habitats, resulting in remarkable ecosystem shifts and consequences for fisheries. The most commonly known example is the habitat expansion of the long-spined sea urchin, where this urchin habitat has expanded into Victorian and Tasmanian waters, resulting in loss of kelp habitat and affecting the multi-million-dollar abalone fisheries in these states. This is not an isolated case […]    THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF FRACKING  The Lancet, Volume 383, Issue 9919, Pages 757 - 758, 1 March 2014 [NB: this is copy-written material and is posted with utmost respect but without permission]  excerpted from www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962700-2/fulltext  Sari Kovats a, Michael Depledge b, Andy Haines a, Lora E Fleming c, Paul Wilkinson a, Seth B Shonkoff d e, Noah Scovronick a […] Fracking is at a very early stage in the UK, with only one shale gas well tested so far. This situation provides an important opportunity to gather information and to conduct studies of health and environmental effects before any large-scale development. Scientific study of the health effects of fracking is in its infancy, [1, 2] but findings suggest that this form of extraction might increase health risks compared with conventional oil and gas wells because of the larger surface footprints of fracking sites; their close proximity to locations where people live, work, and play; and the need to transport and store large volumes of materials. [3—6] In the USA, where more than 52 000 shale gas wells have been drilled, data suggest that risks of environmental contamination occur at all stages in the development of shale gas extraction. Failure of the structural integrity of the well cement and casing, [7] surface spills and leakage from above-ground storage, emissions from gas-processing equipment, and the large numbers of heavy transport vehicles involved are the most important factors that contribute to environmental contamination and exposures in the USA. [2]  Environmental exposures include outdoor air pollutants (ie, volatile organic compounds, tropospheric ozone, and diesel particulate matter) [2] and pollutants (ie, benzene, hydrocarbons, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and heavy metals) in both ground [8] and surface [9, 10] water. Known occupational hazards include airborne silica exposure at the well pad. [11] Toxicological data for the chemicals injected into wells (so-called frac fluid) indicate that many of them have known adverse effects on health, with no toxicological data available for some. [2] Assessment of potential risks has been difficult in the USA because drilling operators are not required to disclose which chemicals are used, but the UK Government has accepted the recommendation from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering Working Group on shale gas extraction [1] for full disclosure. [12] Exposure and epidemiological studies—of which there are currently very few—are needed along the entire supply chain of shale gas to characterise and quantify associated health issues. The socioeconomic implications of shale gas development on local communities before, during, and after extraction, and how risks should be communicated, are also important research priorities.

A 'PDF' refers to a ""partially diminished fraction of an ecosystem,"" and if your shampoo contains palm oil cultivated on clearcut jungle in Borneo, say, that value will be high. How about your shampoo's DALY? This measure comes from public health: ""disability adjusted life years,"" the amount of one's life that will be lost to a disabling disease because of, say, a liftetime's cumulative exposure to a given industrial chemical. So if your favorite shampoo contains two common ingredients, the carcinogen 1,4 dioxane, or BHA , an endocrine disrupter, its DALY will be higher.  PDFs and DALYs are among myriad metrics for Anthropocene thinking, which views how human systems impact the global systems that sustain life. This way of perceiving interactions between the built and the natural worlds comes from the geological sciences. If adopted more widely this lens might usefully inform how we find solutions to the singular peril our species faces: the extinction of our ecological niche.

Not so much has been written about all that follows. It's the ""everything else"" that has turned a drilling technology into a land-and-water-devouring industry so vast that it's arguably one of the most pervasive extractive adventures in history.  According to Cornell University's Anthony Ingraffea, the co-author of a study that established the global warming footprint of the industry, fracking ""involves much more than drill-the-well-frack-the-well-connect-the-pipeline-and-go-away."" Almost all other industries ""occur in a zoned industrial area, inside of buildings, separated from home and farm, separated from schools."" By contrast, the industry spawned by fracking ""permits the oil and gas industries to establish [their infrastructures] next to where we live. They are imposing on us the requirement to locate our homes, hospitals, and schools inside their industrial space.""[…]    MEDICINE, MONOPOLY AND MALICE  Stephanie Bartlett  The Lancet, Volume 381, Issue 9869, Page 795, 9 March 2013 www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2960614-5/fulltext  doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60614-5  FIRE IN THE BLOOD  Directed, produced, and written by Dylan Mohan Gray. A Sparkwater India Production/Dartmouth Films, 2012. On general release in the UK fireintheblood.com  “If it is true that one death is a tragedy, and a million deaths a statistic, then this is a story about statistics.” So begins 'Fire in the Blood,' a compelling documentary by Dylan Mohan Gray. There is, however, nothing remotely prosaic about this story. The film is a powerful exposé of the geopolitics of access to essential HIV medicines in the developing world. It is a David versus Goliath tale of how an unlikely coalition of people worldwide joined forces to fight against the patent monopolies of the world's biggest pharmaceutical conglomerates and secure the right to distribute low-cost antiretroviral drugs to those who need it most.  Mohan Gray gives an unapologetically raw view of the extent to which pharmaceutical companies blocked the sale of generic HIV treatment; in the film he makes the point that between 1996 and 2003, more than 10 million people are estimated to have died from HIV/AIDS in developing countries while life-saving antiretroviral drugs were transforming the lives of those in high-income nations. Patent laws in force at the time made it illegal to make, sell, or import low-cost generic drugs, while the annual price tag of up to about US$15 000 per patient put patented antiretrovirals far out of the reach of patients in poor countries.[…]    Something of a hot topic now, for your attention.

DIVE!""    TOBACCO IN THE USA: Smoke and Mirrors  The Lancet, Volume 379, Issue 9813, Page 288, 28 January 2012  www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960124-X/fulltext  In an episode of the science fiction series 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,' a trio of capitalist aliens find themselves thrown back in time to 1947. They are overjoyed to discover human beings—including medical staff—smoking tobacco. “If they'll buy poison, they'll buy anything!” cackles one of the protagonists, smelling a profit.  When future historians look back on the long and unhappy story of people and tobacco, what will be said about our current era? The American Lung Association's report, 'State of Tobacco Control 2012,' [www.stateoftobaccocontrol.org] gives some clues. In retrospect, it will seem incredible that 60 years after Richard Doll confirmed the link between smoking and lung cancer, and 40 years since a US President declared war on cancer, 2011 was “an abysmal year for tobacco control at the state level”. Comprehensive smoke-free laws were not passed by any state. In one—Nevada—they were weakened. Tobacco taxes were not raised, and smoking prevention programmes were cut. The litigiousness of the tobacco industry amazes now and will continue to amaze for decades to come. The report details the lawsuits that have been filed against the US Food and Drug Administration in an effort to hamper smoking prevention efforts, such as restricting sales to youths and adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packets. Where does the Federal Government stand? Although commendable in some areas—for example, in its ongoing efforts to implement the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act—it continues to dawdle over the submission of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to the Senate, despite having signed it back in 2004.  Renewed effort at State and Federal levels is needed to put tobacco where it belongs: in the history books, as a sad and strange episode in the story of human health. The colourful magazine advertisements of a few decades ago, featuring doctors endorsing cigarettes, seem alien to us now. Hopefully the current arguments over cigarette packaging and sales restriction will seem equally bizarre to future generations.    KEEP IT CLEAN: HOSPITAL ACQUIRED INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN  Nick Feasey and, Elizabeth Molyneux The Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9808, Pages 1982 - 1983, 10 December 2011  ""Prevention of puerperal fever in hospital through hand-washing was described as long ago as the mid-19th century by Ignaz Semmelweis. During the past 20 years hospital-acquired infections have come to dominate the health system agenda[…]  […]the mortality from hospital-acquired bacteraemia is high at 53%, and the patients most affected are those who are malnourished or have a long hospital stay. Knowledge of the causes of such infections in Kilifi is helpful and it would be useful to know their antibiotic sensitivities to guide management in hospitals without blood-culture facilities. The findings in this study are likely to show only a small part of the problem; surgical-site and obstetric hospital-acquired infections are probably major problems in resource-poor settings and tuberculosis has much potential as a nosocomial agent in overcrowded wards with poor isolation facilities.  What can be done to prevent hospital-acquired infections in resource-poor countries? Harbath and Gestmale report that 40% of nosocomial infections might be preventable. Simple hand-washing with soap and water has much potential to reduce cross infections.  In a malnutrition unit in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, the same bacteria were grown from the floor, beds, towels, and sinks as caused bloodstream infections in children staying in the ward. Hospitals need a culture of safety and awareness of infections; they also need an infection control committee to train staff and patients in infection prevention and to monitor results actively. Some hospital administrators might be unwilling to put money and effort into infection control because they do not think it will generate revenue. True, but control of hospital infections might go a long way towards reduction of costs.[…]""  www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2961783-2/fulltext or, in pdf form, - download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673611617832.pdf    MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA  Carsten Krüger   The Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9799, Pages 1293 - 1294, 8 October 2011  ""[…]The practice of medicine not only involves biomedical science and knowledge, but it is also an art: the art of applying medical knowledge, the art of interaction with the patient, the art of judgment about what might be appropriate for a particular patient.

Lomita's family put a great emphasis on education and she went through secondary school with dreams of being a doctor. Her test scores, though, weren't high enough and she was unsure what to do.

With a $600 check we rescued her and now she is an integral part of our family and business - and won the hearts of all who have got to know her including my mother-in-law.  Tassie is the nickname she prefers to be called by as her pedigree name is rather a long one – It started out as Aotearoa Tassie. (Aotearoa is the Maori name for New Zealand and Tassie is short for Tasmania – the island state of Australia - a hidden gem and a destination my wife and I regard as somewhat special.).   However, it wasn’t long before we found that when Tassie is in a demanding mood to go out for a quick pee she jumps from a sitting position like a Kangaroo and talks to me about the urgency of the matter – eye to eye – fair dinkum! Whoops almost forgot to mention that I’m 6ft 2+.

Things like saying the first thing that pops into your head without thinking, eating lots of fried food, having substantial arm hair, wearing raincoats inside out, and being kind to squirrels.  One interesting fun fact:  In Blottosobia, floors are numbered from the top of the building down. It is thus important before getting into an elevator to determine how many stories the building has or you won't know which floor to get off on. Further complicating the matter is that the numbers 2, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, and 22 are considered unlucky and there are no floors with those numbers.  A Blottosobia travel tip:  Because of a metal shortage, the Blottosobian central government in 1999 banned making change after a retail purchase. Nowadays, if customers overpay a merchant, he writes an IOU on their arms or legs with a Sharpie pen. This IOU is good for future purchases, and gets crossed off their arms or legs by the merchant when the IOU is used.",0,Common Interest,2008-09-23,4,0,1925,http://www.kiva.org/team/friends_of_blottosobia,0,0

0,0,2.5,"We loan because... It helps others and it's fun... The goal of this team is to be a team for everyone. A sort of catch-all the accepts everyone no matter what your interests, location, or background.  One of the best videos on microfinance: www.goo.gl/sVkdK4 It's of Muhammad Yunus, the developer of microfinance.  We want to grow Kiva by inviting people to it.  Kiva's invite rate is 0.28 (as of 1.17.13). If we could bring that to 1.0 or near 1.0, Kiva would grow near exponentially.  All a 1.0 invite rate means is that each person on Kiva successfully invites just one other new person to Kiva.  I know we can do it. You can generally invite people to Kiva here: www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites  or specifically to team Universe and Kiva here: www.kiva.org/team/universe/recruit  Another interesting tidbit: ""The microfinance sector currently has an estimated total loan volume of USD 25 bn. Yet, it is unable to serve more than a fraction (~100 m) of today's total sector demand of roughly 1 bn micro-borrowers. This situation translates into an immense funding gap estimated at around USD 250 bn."" see www.goo.gl/Lg6hIC  We want our team to be a catch all that anyone with any interest can join. But we also want to invite tons of other people to join Kiva. Let's make Kiva grow.  ***** There might be free $25 loan if someone accepts your invite. Go to: www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites  Another name for our team could be ""All"" or ""Other"" because we are a catch all for anything and everything else.  Everyone is encouraged to join this team, no matter what your interests.  Sure, we want to lend to others. But perhaps even more important is to invite all of our friends through email, Facebook, and whatever else.  We want more and more people to use Kiva through whatever means available, including telling our friends, Kiva gifts cards, Twitter, and, when available, the free $25 first-timer loans: www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites  My story is an interesting example: I've invited hundreds, if not thousands of people, primarily by using my email contacts, but also through Facebook. I've only been able to make 33 loans so far, but my successful invitees have collectively made 34 loans.  Out of the hundreds or thousand of invites I've sent out, only 3 have been successful.  But those invites have had a greater total dollar impact than my own lending.  When you look at the successful invites that my invites have sent, the impact is even greater.  Most of us can make a little difference by lending a little of our money, but we can make a huge difference by getting a few of our friends to lend a little money as well, and then passing it on down the line.  My journey with Kiva all started with my sister giving me a gift card, it took almost the whole year, just before it expired, for me to even use it. Don't get discouraged if your invites seem to go unnoticed. It might take thousands of invites before someone accepts and makes their first loan.  But that person might be Bill Gates, or might invite Bill Gates.  I don't think most people join Kiva because they stumbled upon it, they join it because they were invited by someone just like you.  Were you invited to Kiva?",Universe,73,,0,Local Area,2010-11-13,29,0,1825,http://www.kiva.org/team/universe,0,0

Half world population is living with 2.5$/day or less.  If you feeling PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE for lack of World Social Welfare system,  you can commit to lend percentage of your earnings (5-10% recommended) straight to poorest.  How to think this Kiva microlending project is as a charity?  Actually it becomes close to best charity! Example: Let's say you've commited  to lend 5% of your wage  which is 100$ for 1 month. So you can consider, that your loan 'interest' ( let's say 10% annual) from this amount ( equal 10$) will went to charity. So if you want to donate ~10$/month to charity, what you need to do is to lend 100$/month every of 12 months.  Then after 1 year you just need to keep re-lending same money again or add/withdraw a little, according to your wage changes.  Can you do 10% from your wage? That's what most religions recommend to share.  Looks a lot? But we are offering NOT to share, but just To LEND 10% without interest. Which is equal to 0.83% of your wage will be donated.   Can we? No? Ok. Can we start with commitment for 1% of wage lended, until our awareness will rise? Do you feel like getting above average World person?   Keep in mind, there is a small risk of no return as well, which you can adjust next year!  You can add gift certificates as well.",Ethic World Social Welfare,66,"About us  With our lended money we (Ethic_World_Social_Welfare team members) want support Ethic Mindful Persons (like raw, organic food) and downgrade unethic (mindless) ones (like alcohol, animal growing for meat, ).  Recommendation to Members: 1) To support the poorest one FIRST!

Muslims thus consider him the restorer of an uncorrupted original monotheistic faith (islām) of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets.He was also active as a diplomat, merchant, philosopher, orator, legislator, reformer, military general, and, according to Muslim belief, an agent of divine action.  Born in 570 in the Arabian city of Mecca, he was orphaned at an early age and brought up under the care of his uncle Abu Talib. He later worked mostly as a merchant, as well as a shepherd, and was first married by age 25. Discontented with life in Mecca, he retreated to a cave in the surrounding mountains for meditation and reflection. According to Islamic beliefs it was here, at age 40, in the month of Ramadan, where he received his first revelation from God. Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that ""God is One"", that complete ""surrender"" to Him is the only way acceptable to God, and that he himself was a prophet and messenger of God, in the same vein as other Islamic prophets. Muhammad gained a few followers early on, and was met with hostility from some Meccan tribes; he and his followers were treated harshly. To escape persecution, Muhammad sent some of his followers to Abyssinia before he and his remaining followers in Mecca migrated to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, which is also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the conflicting tribes, and after eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, his followers, who by then had grown to 10,000, conquered Mecca. In 632, a few months after returning to Medina from his Farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and passed away. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam, and he had united the tribes of Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity.  The revelations (or Ayat, lit. ""Signs of God"")–which Muhammad reported receiving until his death–form the verses of the Qur'an, regarded by Muslims as the “Word of God” and around which the religion is based. Besides the Qur'an, Muhammad’s life (sira) and traditions (sunnah) are also upheld by Muslims. They discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence, adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned. While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and premodern times were largely negative, appraisals in modern history have been far less so.",0,Friends,2011-02-14,9,0,1275,http://www.kiva.org/team/prophet_muhammad_peace_be_upon_him,0,0

Milk is the symbol of the first aspect of love, that of care and affirmation. Honey symbolizes the sweetness of life, the love for it and the happiness in being alive. Most mothers are capable of giving “milk”, but only a minority of giving “honey” too. In order to be able to give honey, a mother must not only be a “good mother”, but a happy person – and this aim is not achieved by many. The effect on the child can hardly be exaggerated. Mother’s love for life is as infectious as her anxiety is. Both attitudes have a deep effect on the child’s whole personality; one can distinguish indeed, among children – and adults – those who got only “milk” and those who got “milk and honey”.",0,Common Interest,2013-09-27,2,0,1150,http://www.kiva.org/team/wonderful_women_at_work,0,0

We in-need of loan to help impliment and support of our baseball program in Cambodia.,Cambodia Baseball,45,"About us Cambodia Baseball is a non-profit group with the U.S. 501 (c)(3) Federal Tax ID. We're dedicated to bringing the joy and learning of baseball to young people in Cambodia.  _________________________________________________  Here is Joe's story in his own words:    ""Hello, I'm Joe Cook, Cambodian-American, 35 years old married with two children. I have worked as a chef for over 15 years and currently work at the Mikata Japanese Steakhouse in Dothan, Alabama. I first fell in love with baseball when I came to America at 12 years old.   Escaping to America  ""During the 1970s, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge began brutally enforcing radical communism. Mass executions, starvation and disease killed more than two million Cambodians - including my father and two younger sisters.   ""Land mines and other wire mines also killed over 80,000 people and wounded 900,000 more. I was one of those wounded by a wire tree mine.   ""Since the day I was born in 1970, I experienced suffering due to war, poverty, illness and no education. After my father was killed, my family was sent to work in labor camps - and in 1976 three of my sisters were separated and lost. In late 1978, when I was eight years old, my mother, oldest brother and me escaped from our camp and began a journey to the Thailand border.   ""We walked and ran bare foot for four days and three nights. I was starved and exhausted and near death, following my accident with the tree wire mine, but we made it to the border. And, after four miraculous years in refugee camps, we came to Chattanooga, Tennessee on May 13, 1983.   ""I am very lucky and proud to be in America.   Traveling back to Cambodia    ""Nearly twenty years after coming to America, I heard that my sister was alive and I went back to Cambodia to reunite with her and her family in May 2002.   ""While I was there, my niece and nephew took me to see their school and friends.   ""After seeing the school, I knew what I must do to help the children and the school. I told them that when I came back I would bring baseball and school supplies.   ""No one had ever heard anything about baseball before - and had no idea what I was talking about. At the time, I had no equipment to show them so I promised that when I came back to Cambodia I would bring some.    ""A few weeks later, back in Dothan, Alabama I began collecting school and baseball equipment to send to those children in Cambodia. And I am extremely grateful to the those who helped me collect these supplies.   Baseball is born in Cambodia   ""In November 2002, I returned to Cambodia as promised with gifts for the children and donations of school and baseball equipment for the MeasChum school in the city Baribo, 68 miles west of Phnom Penh.   ""Over the following days, I helped the children build Cambodia's first baseball field. And on November 26, 2002 baseball was 'born' in Cambodia and I officially introduced it to people for the first time.   ""I taught the children and teachers how to pitch, throw, catch, hit and run the bases. They soon got the idea - and I was so happy to see children playing baseball for the first in Cambodia.   ""In Baribo, baseball has grown into a very popular sport. More and more children and adults have gotten involved. Some players had walked over three days to play or learn baseball.    ""Within five months, the people and the Mayor of Baribo donated land to build a second ballpark called Koom Baseball Field.   ""Baseball equipment is hard to come by for these players and many play with bare feet and no gear. Baseballs, themselves, are in limited supply too. And never thrown away regardless of their condition. I am always looking for extra equipment. And, now, there are more than 50 schools that would love to participate.   Coaching Baseball from a world away   ""Since 2002, I have been coaching baseball from across the globe - via the internet.   ""Every night in Dothan (Cambodia is 12 hours ahead), I go online to communicate with those who run the programs for me in Cambodia.    On my off days from the restaurant, I go to local high schools and ballparks to videotape baseball games to send to Cambodia. these tapes are a great teaching tool for the players.   ""Bringing baseball to Cambodia is my passion. And I am determined to help others have a better life.   ""Thanks to generous support from people like you, we are making progress. But I am hopeful we can do much more. Today, we're working to raise funds to create two new ball fields in the provinces of Kompong Chnang and Kompong Cham. And we're always collecting baseball gear"".    If you would like to learn more about how you or your organization can make a donation, please contact us at joe@cambodiabaseball.org or joecook_@hotmail.com.

As we discussed these topics and looked for ways that we could possibly help and make a difference, a great idea began to germinate.  Our dinner discussion started as a desire to help those less fortunate.  It started as a challenge amongst ourselves, but we decided that it could be much bigger than that.  QLS has decided to target Kiva as a preferred charity.  Along with our employees, we will be including information on our website about Kiva and will be inviting clients and vendors to participate in our efforts to further the Kiva mission.    Our Challenge:  First.  We have decided to pick one day a month and not eat anything for 24 hours (skipping 2 meals).  The purpose of this fast is to allow ourselves to feel and relate in a very small way to what millions around the world experience every day.    Second.  In addition to fostering this compassionate experience, we are going to take the money we would have spent on the uneaten food and use that to fund our Kiva microloans.",Quantum Loyalty Systems,30,"About us Quantum co-workers, its clients, business associates and international licenced affiliates",0,Businesses,2010-04-13,10,0,950,http://www.kiva.org/team/quantum_loyalty_systems,0,0

Although the cause of ALS is not completely understood, the last decade has brought a wealth of new scientific understanding about the disease that provides hope for the future.  Lou Gehrig first brought national and international attention to the disease in 1939 when he abruptly retired from baseball after being diagnosed with ALS. Most commonly, the disease strikes people between the ages of 40 and 70, and as many as 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time. ALS has cut short the lives of other such notable and courageous individuals as Hall of Fame pitcher Jim ""Catfish"" Hunter, Senator Jacob Javits, actors Michael Zaslow and David Niven, creator of Sesame Street Jon Stone, boxing champion Ezzard Charles, NBA Hall of Fame basketball player George Yardley, pro football player Glenn Montgomery, golfer Jeff Julian, golf caddie Bruce Edwards, musician Lead Belly (Huddie Ledbetter), photographer Eddie Adams, entertainer Dennis Day, jazz musician Charles Mingus, composer Dimitri Shostakovich, former vice president of the United States Henry A.

Over the next seven weeks, the crowd grew as the fledgling church met in the banquet facilities of the Sheraton North in Warrendale and the Chadwick banquet facilities in Wexford. In March of 1998, New Community Church began holding services at Marshall Middle School; and almost seven years later, on December 12, 2004, our prayer of moving into our own facility on a 26-acre plot of land at the corner of Route 910 and Pearce Mill Road in Pine Township became a reality.  From the very start, several things set the gatherings apart. The time spent over coffee after the services took on an importance to the people at New Community. It was something about the chance to go deeper and to connect face to face rather than just come and go. A vast majority of our people connected into small groups, meeting in homes from Wexford to the South Hills. “Community” was more than our middle name – it was who we were. Our teaching and worship was marked by God's power. People would come for their first time and sense something different, something powerful from God. They would come to try it once and would come back and become a part because they were finding something at New Community that was feeding their souls.   Today, we have three services each Sunday. Almost 800 people gather at those services. It is not uncommon for around 500 to stay after the service to connect over coffee at the Community Cafe. Children are growing, begging their parents not to let them miss a Sunday in our Kids’ Kingdom Ministry. Teens are finding direction in the turbulent years of middle and high school in our Student Ministries.   Our future continues to fill us with excitement and hope as we use New Community Church to touch and change lives and trust God for tomorrow.",0,Religious Congregations,2009-12-13,2,0,725,http://www.kiva.org/team/newcommunitychurch,0,0

MISSION  The One-Dress Project's mission is to work with and support women’s organizations around the world to enhance and protect women’s health, reduce violence against women, support women to play an active role in society and champion them as they fight for their rights.  VISION  Social and economic justice, the foundations of global well-being, can only be achieved by ensuring women's health, safety, human rights, and equality.  Accordingly, the One-Dress Project envisions achieving the following goals through our strategic partnerships around the world:  1. To enable women access to information and services they need to enhance and protect their health 2. To eliminate violence against women 3. To mobilize political will and resources for women’s rights and development 4. To increase women’s participation in civil and political processes  However, we are only able to pursue our goals thanks to the kindness and generosity of people as well as organizations who entrust us with their continued support.",One Dress Project,29,"About us The One-Dress Project's raison d'être (reason for existence) is to raise awareness and funds on behalf of organizations around the world that enhance and protect women’s health, reduce violence against women, educate young girls, and support women to play an active role in society.  The ""One Dress"" has been collectively designed and created by women from around the globe via online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, ASmallWorld, YoutTube as well as the One Dress Project Online Community.   Women from around the world were asked to share information about their lifestyle, personal desires, and visions for a better world. Women also shared, for the sake of this project, how their lives relate to one simple - but truly important piece of clothing - the DRESS. By sharing their likes and dislikes in fabrics, colors, necklines, silhouettes, seasons, etc. the ""One Dress"" was conceived, incubated and now released into the universe.  A portion of all profits from the One Dress Project will go to benefit the following organizations/charities: CARE (www.care.org) and KIVA (www.kiva.org).",0,Common Interest,2008-09-6,5,0,725,http://www.kiva.org/team/onedressproject,0,0

0,0,5.4,We loan because... We Care,Dr. Abdus Salam,27,"About us We are friends and students of Dr. Muhammad Abdus Salam.  Dr. Salam was a Pakistani theoretical physicist, and astrophysicist. He became Nobel laureate in Physics for his work on the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces.  Abdus Salam was born in Jhang, a small town in what is now Pakistan, in 1926. His father was an official in the Department of Education in a poor farming district. His family has a long tradition of piety and learning.   When he cycled home from Lahore, at the age of 14, after gaining the highest marks ever recorded for the Matriculation Examination at the University of the Punjab, the whole town turned out to welcome him. He won a scholarship to Government College, University of the Punjab, and took his MA in 1946. In the same year he was awarded a scholarship to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he took a BA (honours) with a double First in mathematics and physics in 1949. In 1950 he received the Smith's Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to physics. He also obtained a PhD in theoretical physics at Cambridge; his thesis, published in 1951, contained fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics which had already gained him an international reputation.   Salam returned to Pakistan in 1951 to teach mathematics at Government College, Lahore, and in 1952 became head of the Mathematics Department of the Punjab University. He had come back with the intention of founding a school of research, but it soon became clear that this was impossible. To pursue a career of research in theoretical physics he had no alternative at that time but to leave his own country and work abroad. Many years later he succeeded in finding a way to solve the heartbreaking dilemma faced by many young and gifted theoretical physicists from developing countries. At the ICTP, Trieste, which he created, he instituted the famous ""Associateships"" which allowed deserving young physicists to spend their vacations there in an invigorating atmosphere, in close touch with their peers in research and with the leaders in their own field, losing their sense of isolation and returning to their own country for nine months of the academic year refreshed and recharged.   In 1954 Salam left his native country for a lectureship at Cambridge, and since then has visited Pakistan as adviser on science policy. His work for Pakistan has, however, been far-reaching and influential. He was a member of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, a member of the Scientific Commission of Pakistan and was Chief Scientific Adviser to the President from 1961 to 1974.   Since 1957 he has been Professor of Theoretical Physics at Imperial College, London, and since 1964 has combined this position with that of Director of the ICTP, Trieste.   For more than forty years he has been a prolific researcher in theoretical elementary particle physics. He has either pioneered or been associated with all the important developments in this field, maintaining a constant and fertile flow of brilliant ideas. For the past thirty years he has used his academic reputation to add weight to his active and influential participation in international scientific affairs. He has served on a number of United Nations committees concerned with the advancement of science and technology in developing countries.   To accommodate the astonishing volume of activity that he undertakes, Professor Salam cuts out such inessentials as holidays, parties and entertainments. Faced with such an example, the staff of the Centre find it very difficult to complain that they are overworked.   He has a way of keeping his administrative staff at the ICTP fully alive to the real aim of the Centre - the fostering through training and research of the advancement of theoretical physics, with special regard to the needs of developing countries. Inspired by their personal regard for him and encouraged by the fact that he works harder than any of them, the staff cheerfully submit to working conditions that would be unthinkable here at the (International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna (IAEA). The money he received from the Atoms for Peace Medal and Award he spent on setting up a fund for young Pakistani physicists to visit the ICTP. He uses his share of the Nobel Prize entirely for the benefit of physicists from developing countries and does not spend a penny of it on himself or his family.   Abdus Salam is known to be a devout Muslim, whose religion does not occupy a separate compartment of his life; it is inseparable from his work and family life. He once wrote: ""The Holy Quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah's created laws of nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I render thanks with a humble heart.""  The biography was written by Miriam Lewis, now at IAEA, Vienna, who was at one time on the staff of ICTP (International Centre For Theoretical Physics, Trieste).  Dr. Abdus Salam died on November 21, 1996, and has been laid to rest in his beloved country Pakistan.",0,Friends,2011-02-14,5,0,675,http://www.kiva.org/team/dr_abdus_salam,0,0

(Please donate here: justgiving.com/noturningyak)  Once we arrive in Ulaanbaatar, we will be donating our ambulance to the people of Mongolia. Emergency vehicles are critical components of health care delivery systems, but they’re expensive, so poor countries like Mongolia (where 1/3 of the population lives in poverty) don’t have enough. In order to deliver the vehicle, we need your help -- used ambulances cost more than $6000! Additionally, we’re raising money for Christina Noble Children’s Foundation in Mongolia (www.cncf.org/en/home/index.php), and Kiva (www.kiva.org/). We’ll split the money raised (after the cost of the ambulance) between these two charities:  Christina Noble Children’s Foundation is doing incredible work in Mongolia. The money we and other Mongol Rally participants raise will go towards supporting the Blue Skies Ger Village, which cares for abandoned kids in Ulaanbaatar. About 1/3 of Mongolians are under the age of 18, they’re the future of the country, and so your donations will help give a few more of those kids a fair shot at life!   Kiva provides funding to microfinance institutions around the globe. These microfinance institutions provide small loans to individuals to start and grow their businesses. For the world's working poor little or no access to banks, these microloans can help them create better lives for themselves and their families. We think that’s pretty sweet! Plus, Dan worked for Kiva for awhile, and can attest to it being a well-run nonprofit (which we think is pretty critical)! Half of the money raised for Kiva will be used to finance microloans, while half will be donated to Kiva itself.  We would greatly appreciate any support you can provide to these causes! And please help us spread the word! The link to donate is: justgiving.com/noturningyak  After we depart from London on July 23rd, you will be able to follow our progress on facebook as we navigate across two continents and learn more about people and places that most Westerners don't the chance to experience.  THANK YOU!!!

But perhaps even more important is to invite all of our friends through email, Facebook, and whatever else.  We want more and more people to use Kiva through whatever means available, including telling our friends, Kiva gifts cards, Twitter, and, when available, the free $25 first-timer loans: www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites  My story is an interesting example: I've invited hundreds, if not thousands of people, primarily by using my email contacts, but also through Facebook. I've only been able to make 33 loans so far, but my successful invitees have collectively made 34 loans.  Out of the hundreds or thousand of invites I've sent out, only 3 have been successful.  But those invites have had a greater total dollar impact than my own lending.  When you look at the successful invites that my invites have sent, the impact is even greater.  Most of us can make a little difference by lending a little of our money, but we can make a huge difference by getting a few of our friends to lend a little money as well, and then passing it on down the line.  My journey with Kiva all started with my sister giving me a gift card, it took almost the whole year, just before it expired, for me to even use it. Don't get discouraged if your invites seem to go unnoticed. It might take thousands of invites before someone accepts and makes their first loan.  But that person might be Bill Gates, or might invite Bill Gates.  I don't think most people join Kiva because they stumbled upon it, they join it because they were invited by someone just like you.  Were you invited to Kiva?",0,Common Interest,2012-05-25,7,0,450,http://www.kiva.org/team/kiva_growers,0,0

The now famous preamble of the second section reads “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” A few years later Thomas Jefferson would make the first step in abolishing slavery in America by passing an act restricting the importation of slaves.   Please watch:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBtVBh9Ok0   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTcVNuNX8yY   1939 – Marion Morrison better known as actor “John Wayne” becomes an American icon.  He would later serve in the Pacific theatre during World War 2 and in 1979 Congress recognized his achievements by awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal and then lastly the Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded as well in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter.  These medals are the two highest civilian decorations awarded by the United States government.   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo3FbQjKEBs   March 19, 1941 – June 1941 – An elite group of African Americans formed the 99th Pursuit Squadron at the Tuskegee Institute to combat and liberate Europe and Asia from tyrannical forces abroad.  By the end of the war not a single American Bomber was reported lost in combat during escort missions by the Tuskegee Airmen.   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=057NX5jBfK8   June 6, 1944 – REAL Americans launch the largest amphibious invasion of all time smashing through German defenses at Omaha and Utah beaches and proceeding to Liberate Western Europe from under Hitler and the Nazi’s control.

That same day Vietnam War veteran Ron Paul M.D. would enter politics.  Congressman Ron Paul was among the first to support Ronald Reagan in his Presidential campaign due to his beliefs in limited-federal government, sound money, personal liberty, and freedom.  A conservative Libertarian-Republican; Dr. Ron Paul has achieved the most conservative voting record in Congress since 1937.  He is also a published author and is considered by many “The Champion of the Constitution.”  Ron Paul M.D. winner of the Republican CPAC straw poll and a great American patriot is currently on track to defeat incumbent President Barack Obama in the 2012 Presidential election.   Please watch:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWyygiyPbdA   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=vthdr96EDnE   August 10, 1977 – Mr. America “Hulk Hogan” 12 time world heavyweight champion is born and would later help to deter and tear down communism throughout the modern world.   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjWDrTXMgF8   November 1984 – President Ronald Reagan is re-elected with a landslide election winning 49 of the 50 U.S. states.  Using “Reaganomics” throughout his two term presidency the inflation rate dropped from 12.5% to 4.4%, the unemployment rate fell from 10.8% to 5.3%, and very large across-the-board tax cuts helped stimulate the economy and federal income tax receipts nearly doubled from 1980-1989.  Towards the end of his Presidency he would finally put an end to the Cold War with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and liberating Germany from under Communist rule.  Reaganomics would live on throughout the 90s until the Democrat Carter-Era Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and mandated sub-prime loans of the mid 90s led to the modern financial crisis.   Please watch:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wusgcG4rfo   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRdLpem-AAs   1996 – Alex Jones, a radio broadcaster, begins his fight against tyranny world-wide.   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ku5u6X6LmM   2003 – Two-term President George W. Bush liberates Iraq and Afghanistan ending decades of tyranny in the Middle East.  Amidst rising oil prices from a falling U.S. dollar and under pressure George W. Bush knowing the hazards of offshore drilling reluctantly lifts the offshore drilling ban in 2008 saying “This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.” George W. Bush’s worst fears would become reality shortly after leaving office President Obama further supported lifting the offshore drilling plan leading up to the worst oil spill in World history devastating the gulf regions.  The Bush administration also attempted to reign in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Mortgage lenders warning of an impending financial meltdown unless regulators act.  These warning fell on deaf ears and nothing was done to stop the financial crisis.  Before leaving office George W. Bush did what little he could to help stimulate and save the U.S. economy by arranging massive bailouts so that American workers could keep their jobs and avoid or postponing a 2nd Great Depression.   Please watch:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMnSp4qEXNM   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8gzfpl2V_c   2005 – Chuck Norris, a martial arts expert and Christian book writer, becomes an American Legend.   Want to learn more?   www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-h1vgIPSCA   2006 – Peyton Manning, a 4-time NFL MVP, wins the Super Bowl.   Want to learn more?  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng1x1sDpdWs   2010- Peter Schiff, a financial expert on the economy as well as a published author and Ron Paul’s chief economic advisor and predictor of the U.S. financial crisis of 2008, is campaigning in Connecticut to become a U.S. Senator.

So, if you don't want to donate that much, PayPal me (jordy.clements@gmail.com) or Dwolla me (812-735-3988) or mail me or hand me $10, and I will donated on your behalf.   If we don't get to the goal, I'll try to make up the difference, and if we do make it there, hey, maybe I'll give a little more. Plus, remember it's Kiva: YOU'RE PROBABLY GETTING ALL YOUR MONEY BACK.  And oh, by the way.   Thanks.   {see you next year}",0,Friends,2012-02-6,9,0,300,http://www.kiva.org/team/Jordys_Birthday_Team,0,0

Household energy efficiency in Tajikistan The GTZ programme Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) and its regional programme in Central Asia are now starting to adapt and disseminate improved stoves in the Pamir region of Tajikistan. The GTZ/DED project “Sustainable Management of Natural Resources in Gorno-Badakhshan (Tajikistan)” will put a focus on the adaptation and dissemination of energy efficient technologies in the Pamir Mountains. It is part of the Regional Project to Support the Implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UN CCD) in Central Asia.  People in the Pamir region are increasingly suffering from a severe energy crisis. With the break down of the Soviet Empire, free of charge delivery of coal for all households in the region ceased and people now depend almost entirely on using scarce wood and manure as a substitute to coal. In the Western Pamirs the most important fuel is firewood from the degraded Riperian forests. In the Eastern Pamirs it is Teresken and dung, the former being a semi-shrub that helps prevent the erosion of pasture land in this yak and sheep rearing region.  The project will focus on simple and affordable thermal-insulation measures in private houses, efficient adapted cooking stoves, heat exchangers for existing inefficient metal box ovens and locally producible solar water heaters.  Aimed at a sustainable introduction and dissemination of energy efficient technologies, the project follows a market driven approach. Consequently the following elements will be supported:      Standardization of products and training of local producers in technical and business skills     Awareness building among the local population     A “warm comfort” microfinance product for the thermal-insulation of private houses, which will be reimbursed by the savings in fuel expenditure.",Stoves for Tajikstan,10,"About us Join and encourage microfinance loans for these stoves.

Yet globalization faces a huge democratic deficit as international decisions are shaped by political elites and unaccountable corporations -- not the views and values of the world’s people.  Technology and the internet have allowed citizens to connect and mobilize like never before. The rise of a new model of internet-driven, people-powered politics is changing countries from Australia to the Philippines to the United States. Avaaz takes this model global, connecting people across borders to bring people powered politics to international decision-making.  Coming together in this way, Avaaz has become a wonderful community of people from all nations, backgrounds, and ages.",0,Common Interest,2009-09-22,6,0,250,http://www.kiva.org/team/avaaz,0,0

One message sent out every week; one synchronized act from users across the world. Social Networking with a Cause  While we all have different connections, a feeling of friendship surrounds our site, knowing users across the world are in-step with each other once a week.  As we evolved as a team, we decided it was important to make our site open to all things good. We reached out to different organizations to help promote their awareness. We found fitness and health writers to share their expertise. We recruited service members to write about their experiences helping people in other countries.  Something that was very important for all of us was laughter. We made sure our site had important information but not overlooking the fun of life.  And last, we wanted to ensure the image of goodwill we portrayed, was one of diversity. We ensured the members of our team were people with different beliefs, political stances and ethnic backgrounds all with one thing in common; the desire to make the world a better place.",0,Businesses,2010-08-3,2,0,225,http://www.kiva.org/team/takingmonday,0,0
